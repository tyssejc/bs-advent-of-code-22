hmm.

should I do this in node or python?

node it is then.

what is the input?
- plain text
- list of sets of integers
- one integer per line
- space between each set of integers

I am already overcomplicating things


ok. I downloaded the input as txt file.
node filesystem API to read the text.
dangit what's the dang syntax
what?! you can't use `import` unless it's a module, wtf

npm init I guess? lololol

ok YAY!

ok split by `\n\n`
and then by `\n`
YEESSSSS

now ... array methods to the rescue!

shit. forEach? map?
map! you good ol basterd

now... I want to add all these mofos together ........
reduuuuuuuuce!

shit. sort can be used without an argument but that's not what we want here
ok MDN saves the day again. `array.sort((a,b) => b - a)` FTMFW

YAAAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYA
